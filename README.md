# How to build a modern CI/CD pipeline
## Using free and hosted services

Software developers are problem solvers. Although they can be very tenacious about finding solutions, the moment they have one they want to share it with the world; the feeling of shipping code is great. Code that is never executed for users is no more than a digital waste product. To prevent building waste, modern software developers ship functionality to their users in short iterations and small increments.

A way to ship code in small increments and iterations is by using a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, or CI/CD, pipeline. In this tutorial weâ€™ll go through all the steps in setting up such a pipeline using free and hosted services. From start to end this tutorial shows you in 9 steps how to:

1. Write a little Python program: generator.py (not Hello World)
1. Add some automated tests for the program
1. Push your code to GitHub
1. Setup Travis CI to continuously run your automated tests
1. Setup Better Code Hub to continuously check your code quality
1. Turn the Python program into a web app
1. Create a Docker image for the web app
1. Push the Docker image to Docker Hub
1. Deploy the Docker image to Heroku
